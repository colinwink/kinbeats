   <p> Hello! My name is Colin Winkelmann, and I am a junior at Illinois State University. I am studying <a href="https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/creative-technologies-interdisciplinary/"> Creative Technologies </a>, and I'm enjoying every minute of it! My focuses are on Web Development, Audio Engineering, Video Production, and Game Development. Ever since I was young, I knew that my passion lied somewhere in the realm of Creative Technologies. Most of my free time was spent filming youtube videos (action-shorts) with my neighbor's help. The remainder of my free time was dedicated to composing songs on Garageband. My family would constantly hear me ask "Where's the family iPad?", just so I could migrate the ideas in my head to an actual audio workstation. Technology and creativity are the perfect marriage for me to express my creative ideas. </p>
		<p> My favorite thing to do is compose music digitally. I use FL Studio to create rap beats, ambient pieces, and other electronic songs. During my sophomore year, I wrote the soundtrack (along with a few others) to a game that was developed by the <a href="https://redbirdlife.illinoisstate.edu/organization/gdc">Game Design Team.</a> You can hear the OST for the 2020 Club's Game, Ground Zero, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-413212540/sets/ground-zero-illinois-state?si=a5c60285c66b4c81b95fc75b44292603">here.</a> You can listen to my released beats playlist <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-413212540/sets/rap-beats">here</a>. I also work on some experimental types of music, and I enjoy producing ambient style pieces. My <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-413212540/final-project-in-progress-ctk-345?si=4120f5fa13294b67b7cf7a658e84307a">CTK 345 Final Project</a> is a piece in which I experimented with ambient digital as well as acoustic sounds. </p> <p> Thank you for checking out my page!</p>
